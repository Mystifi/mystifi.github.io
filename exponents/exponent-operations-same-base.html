    <h3>Multiplying Exponents</h3>
    <p>
      In the previous pages, we've already mentioned dividing exponents; the formula for that is \(\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}\). Well, as division is to
      subtraction when applied to exponents, then multiplication is to addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formula we use can be represented like this: \(a^ba^c = a^{b+c}\). Very simple. Let's take an example expression: $$-8x^4y^3\cdot 2x^5y^2$$
      Multiplying \(-8\cdot 2\) will give us sixteen, and since we add the exponent when multiplying, then we can rewrite it as such:
      $$-8x^4y^3\cdot 2x^5y^2 = -16x^{4+5}y^{3+2} = -16x^9y^5$$ It's truly simple.
    </p>
    <h3>Dividing Exponents</h3>
    <p>
      I'm not even going into superb depth with this because it has been mentioned it so many times before; at this point, should you have read the pages in
      order, you'll have seen this so many times. The equation is \(\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}\). Let's just get the example expression over with, except
      we'll rev up the difficulty to maintain your interest. $$\frac{-16a^4-40a^2+24a}{12a^3}$$ Here's a little short-cut that will help you comprehend
      this gargantuan a little easier: take the number of terms on the numerator and isolate each fraction, piecing together each fraction via addition/subtraction:
      $$\frac{-16a^4}{12a^3}-\frac{40a^2}{12a3}+\frac{24a}{12a^3}$$ Okay, now we just simplify each fraction; according to PEMDAS, since addition and subtraction
      have equal precedence, then we can simplify each fraction from left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, we'll start with the first fraction: $$\frac{-16a^4}{12a^3}$$ We'll reduce \(\frac{16}{12}\) and apply \(\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}\) to create an equation:
      $$\frac{-16a^4}{12a^3} = -\left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot a^{4-3}\right)$$ This simply reduces to the following equation:
      $$\frac{-16a^4}{12a^3} = -\left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot a^{4-3}\right) = -\left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot a^1\right) = -\left(\frac{4a}{3}\right) = -\frac{4a}{3}$$
      Congratulations, we have the first part of the problem done! We now have two more fractions left to go: $$-\frac{4a}{3}-\frac{40a^2}{12a3}+\frac{24a}{12a^3}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing with the second fraction in the expression: $$-\frac{40a^2}{12a3}$$ Here's we begin tying in the negative exponent rules. Simplified fully, this is:
      $$-\frac{40a^2}{12a^3} = -\left(\frac{10}{3}\cdot a^{2-3}\right) = -\left(\frac{10}{3}\cdot a^{-1}\right) = -\left(\frac{10}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{a}\right) = -\frac{10}{3a}$$
      We now have one more fraction left to simplify: $$-\frac{4a}{3}-\frac{10}{3a}+\frac{24a}{12a^3}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      We're delving straight into solving the final fraction; we'll have to reuse the negative exponent rule:
      $$\frac{24a}{12a^3} = 2\cdot a^{1-3} = 2\cdot a^{-2} = 2\cdot \frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{2}{a^2}$$ Congratulations, we've arrived at our answer:
      $$-\frac{4a}{3}-\frac{10}{3a}+\frac{2}{a^2}$$
    </p>

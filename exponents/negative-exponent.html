      If you're reading these in the order from top to bottom (as you probably should - I mean, that's how the layout is organised
      in the little navigation area...), then you should have already learned about what bases and exponents are, as well as why
      any number - as far as we know yet in the context of Algebra II/Trig :) - raised to the power of zero is equivalent to one.
    </p>
    <p>(P.S. Knowing the fundamentals of why \(a^0 = 1\) is <em>imperative</em> to understanding why this works the way it does.)</p>
    <p>
      The general rule is that \(a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\). I'll work a problem out before explaining why the zero exponent rule is so
      important.

      So, let's say you have the following expression: $$\frac{18w^4x^9}{14w^5x^5}$$ Again, if you've read about how dividing exponents
      works (if not, then the page is in the navigation area), then you know that you subtract the bottom exponents from the top. Let's
      simplify \(\frac{18}{14}\) before moving to simplifying the entire fraction: $$\frac{9w^4x^9}{7w^5x^5}$$ Following on from the
      zero exponent page, we can rewrite this in the form of \(\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}\): $$\frac{9w^4x^9}{7w^5x^5} = \frac{9}{7}\cdot w^{4-5}x^{9-5}$$
      Simplifying what's written in superscript, we have $$\frac{9w^4x^9}{7w^5x^5} = \frac{9}{7}\cdot w^{4-5}x^{9-5} = \frac{9}{7}\cdot w^{-1}x^4$$
      Okay, we finally have that negative exponent. Remembering that \(a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\), then we rewrite this as such.
      $$\frac{9}{7}\cdot w^{-1}x^4 = \frac{9}{7}\cdot \frac{x^4}{w^1}$$ Since anything raised to the power of itself is one, as well as the fact that
      we're multiplying two fractions together, we can completely simplify this to the following equation. $$\frac{9}{7}\cdot \frac{x^4}{w^1} = \frac{9x^4}{7w}$$
    </p>

      This works for a very interesting reason. The zero exponent rule states that \(\frac{a^c}{a^c} = a^{c-c} = 1\). This is essentially
      equivalent to \(a^ca^{-c} = 1\) in accordance with the rules of multiplying exponents. In order to simplify for \(a^{-c}\), we then divide
      both sides of the equation by \(a^c\): $$\frac{a^{-c}}{a^c} = \frac{1}{a^c}$$ Which reduces to this: $$a^{-c} = \frac{1}{a^c}$$
    </p>
    <p><em>Et voil√† !</em> A very simple - yet important - explanation on why this works.</p>

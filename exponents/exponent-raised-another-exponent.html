      Looking back at the <a href="exponent-operations-same-base.html">previous page</a>, we know that, when multiplying an
      exponent with another exponent with the same base, we simply multiply the bases and add the exponents. This was represented
      with the formula \(a^ba^c = a^{b+c}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, raising an exponent to another exponent is different, just like raising any other number by an exponent is not the
      same as multiplying them by another number. For example, \(x^2\) is \(x\cdot x\), whereas \(9x\) is \(x\cdot 9\), or
      \(x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x\). The rule is that, rather than adding, you multiply the exponents together. We can represent this as
      \(\left(a^b\right)^c = a^{b\cdot c}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following expression: $$5c^{-7}d^2\cdot \left(-cd^2\right)^4$$ We know from the definition of an exponent that
      any number without an explicit exponent is implicitly raised to the power of one, so let's rewrite the second term.
      $$5c^{-7}d^2\cdot \left(-c^1d^2\right)^4$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we multiply the exponent of each term within the parentheses by the exponent outside of the parentheses, we can rewrite
      this to be: $$5c^{-7}d^2\cdot \left(-c^{1\cdot 4}d^{2\cdot 4}\right)$$ This evaluates to $$5c^{-7}d^2\cdot \left(-c^4d^8\right)$$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, now it's a matter of multiplying terms with exponents, which means we multiply the bases while adding the exponents.
      $$5c^{-7}d^2\cdot \left(-c^4d^8\right) = -\left(5c^{-7+4}d^{2+8}\right) = -\left(5c^{-3}d^{10}\right)$$ Alright, we have a
      negative exponent. Nothing serious; going back to <a href="negative-exponent.html">this page</a>, we know that we can apply the
      following expression, \(a^{-c} = \frac{1}{a^c}\), so:
      $$-\left(5c^{-3}d^{10}\right) = -\left(\frac{5d^{10}}{c^3}\right) = -\frac{5d^{10}}{c^3}$$

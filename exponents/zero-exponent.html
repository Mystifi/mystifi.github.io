      Recall from <a href="definitions.html">the previous page</a> that, in the expression \(b^n\), \(n\) is
      the exponent, or the number of times that \(b\) is multiplied by itself. We discussed how anything raised
      to the power of one was itself; if it were raised to the power of two (commonly referred to as <em>squared</em>),
      then it would be \(n\cdot n\), et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>However, if \(n\eq 0\), \(b\eq 1\). Let's break it down a little further.</p>
    <p>
      If you've already read <a href="exponent-operations-same-base.html">Multiplying and Dividing Exponents, Same Base</a>,
      then you're already familiar with the concept of dividing exponents when they share the same base. If you haven't,
      then the formula generally looks like this. $$\frac{a^b}{a^c}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the rules of dividing exponents with the same base, you simply subtract the bottom exponent \(c\) from the
      top exponent, \(b\). Thus, we can infer: $$\frac{a^b}{a^c}\eq a^{b - c}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly, we know this makes sense. Given that any number over itself is 1, we can represent this as \(\frac{a}{a}\eq 1\).
      Since any number without any explicit exponents is implicitly raised to the power of one, we can rewrite this to be
      \(\frac{a^1}{a^1}\eq 1\), which, according to the previous paragraph, is equal to the following equation: \(\frac{a^1}{a^1}\eq a^{1-1}\eq a^0\eq 1\).
      This shows that a number raised to the power of zero is equivalent to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's apply this to the following expression. $$\frac{-6x^2y}{6x^2y}$$ Let's rewrite our expression to include all instances
      of numbers being implicitly raised to the power of one: $$\frac{-6^1x^2y^1}{6^1x^2y^1}$$ Now, we can simply subtract each
      exponent from the top to the bottom: $$-\frac{6^1x^2y^1}{6^1x^2y^1}\eq -(6^{1-1}x^{2-2}y^{1-1})$$ (I simply moved the negative
      one to the outside of the fraction from the numerator.) After simplification: $$-\frac{6^1x^2y^1}{6^1x^2y^1}\eq -(6^0x^0y^0)\eq -(1\cdot 1\cdot 1)\eq -1$$
    </p>

      There is much more that goes into this, but if you're interested, I <em>highly</em> suggest you read
      <a href="https://medium.com/i-math/the-zero-power-rule-explained-449b4bd6934d">this link</a>.

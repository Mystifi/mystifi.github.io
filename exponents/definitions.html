    <h3>Base</h3>
    <p>
      The base of an exponent is the number being multiplied by itself.
      In the expression $b^n$, $b$ would be the only base. It is understood that $b$ is multiplied by one.
      However, in the following expression, $ab^n$ (where $a\neq1$), $a$ and $b$ are the bases. This leads
      us to understand that the number of bases is equivalent to the number of terms before the exponent.
    </p>
    <p>For example, take the following expressions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$-7n^3$</li>
      <li>$-3n^2$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The bases of the first expression are $-7$ and $n$, and the bases of the second expression are $-3$
      and $n$.
    </p>
    <h3>Exponent</h3>
    <p>
      The exponent is the number written in the subscript; it is the number of times you will multiply the
      base by itself. In the expression $a^n$, $n$ is the exponent; this is "shorthand" for writing $a x a (x a (x a...))$
      $n$ times. With this, we know that if $n\eq1$, then $a$ is itself. All numbers without an explicitly
      stated exponent are implied to be raised to the power of one.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there is the oddity of <a href="zero-exponent.html">raising a base to the power of zero</a>.</p>
    <p>Take the following expressions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$-7n^2$</li>
      <li>$9x$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first expression is equivalent to writing $7^1\times\left(n^1\timesn^1\right)$, and the second expression
      is equivalent to $9^1\timesn^1$, but is left better simplified as $9x$.

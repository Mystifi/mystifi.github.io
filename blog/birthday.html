    <h1>13.7.2018</h1>
    <h2>(a.k.a. my father's 41<sup>st</sup> birthday)</h2>

      It seems that, as the years go on, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new ways to express how much someone
      means to you. This is pretty relatable to many people, right? I mean, a lot of the accepted premise around birthdays
      is spending some of your hard-earned money in order to buy something that has some sort of value to the person in
      question, right? At least, that is what we are always led to believe.

    <p>
      Unfortunately, I am broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that isn't a justification for what I'm going to say next. However, it becomes increasingly clear that money is
      not necessary to give a good gift to someone; rather, giving them something unique - something resulting from thinking
      "out of the box," as they say - tends to have more of an impact.

      That is why I am here, writing a "Happy Birthday" card manually on a web page.

      I've known my dad for sixteen years - pretty much the duration of my life. There have been a few gaps here and there,
      mainly stemming from the fact that when I was little, he was deployed pretty frequently. In those years, we've clashed
      head-to-head, argued and bickered over the most trivial things - you know, the typical "emotional-oldest-child-meets-
      logical-head-of-house." However, we have shared a lot of great times together. We've driven all the way up to Nashville to
      watch Breaking Benjamin and Avenged Sevenfold perform; he was basically the one who taught me how to drive; he really
      pushes for us to go on family vacations in Orlando, which is really great, honestly.

      I wouldn't say it's necessarily the easiest to connect with him; a lot of that's on my end. However, in those moments that
      we share - whether it be jamming out to the rock music that Mum would grow tired of hearing, or driving hundreds of miles
      away and knowing that he's still just as confident in me as if I were driving around town - I know that I wouldn't have any
      other father in the world. No, <em>not even if you paid me.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As my father <strong><em><u>should</u></em></strong> be reading this since I made it for him, I want to wish him a happy
      birthday. I know I'm not the easiest kid to deal with by far, but I appreciate everything you do for me and our family,
      and I know I haven't expressed that enough. The prospect of college is daunting, and it makes me realise more and more with
      each passing minute that I don't have much more time to kill before I start branching off into the real world. I'm
      not gonna be a kid for much longer, but I'll be darned if I'm not gonna make sure it counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR Happy birthday, Dad.

      PSSST - I'm still really counting on that trip to Hawai'i after graduation. It could even be a joint graduation-retirement
      vacation. :)
